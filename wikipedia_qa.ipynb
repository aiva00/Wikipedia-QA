              "[<Document: {'content': \"Breaking Bad is  an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.\\nAmong the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.\\nBreaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, direction, cinematography, screenplay, story, and character development. Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all time.\\nThe series gave rise to the larger Breaking Bad franchise. A sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, starring Paul was released on Netflix and in theaters on October 11, 2019. Better Call Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their Breaking Bad roles, as well as many others in guest and recurring appearances, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and concluded on August 15, 2022.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f0c28c9861be5ac554e600a011b0f76e'}>,\n",

Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name \"Heisenberg\" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family\\'s lives at risk.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '23c3b1577ffd985889ff230be4286f4c'}>]"

            " 'documents': [<Document: {'content': \"Breaking Bad is  an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.\\nAmong the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.\\nBreaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, direction, cinematography, screenplay, story, and character development. Since its conclusion, the show has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all time.\\nThe series gave rise to the larger Breaking Bad franchise. A sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, starring Paul was released on Netflix and in theaters on October 11, 2019. Better Call Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising their Breaking Bad roles, as well as many others in guest and recurring appearances, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and concluded on August 15, 2022.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6862564211010898, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f0c28c9861be5ac554e600a011b0f76e'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Critical reception ===\\nBreaking Bad received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as one of the greatest television shows of all time. On the review aggregator website Metacritic (using a scale of 0–100), the first season scored 73, the second 84, the third 89, the fourth 96, and the fifth 99. The American Film Institute listed Breaking Bad as one of the top ten television series of 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. In 2013, TV Guide ranked it as the ninth greatest TV series of all time. By its end, the series was among the most-watched cable shows on American television, with audience numbers doubling from the fourth season to the fifth. A 2015 survey by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named Breaking Bad as their #2 favorite show. In 2016 and 2022, Rolling Stone ranked it third on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In September 2019, The Guardian ranked the show fifth on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, describing it as \"The show that arguably killed off the antihero drama; nothing since has been able to top the depraved descent made by Walter White (a never-better Bryan Cranston), from milquetoast chemistry teacher to meth overlord, and few have dared to try.\" In 2021, Empire ranked Breaking Bad at number one on their list of The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. Allen St. John of Forbes called it \"The best TV show ever\". In 2021, it was voted the third-best TV series of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 206 TV experts from around the world.For the first season, the series saw a generally positive reception. New York Post critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating \"Cranston and Paul are so good, it\\'s astounding. I\\'d say the two have created great chemistry, but I\\'m ashamed to say such a cheap thing.\" Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming \"There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt\\'s efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work.\"The second season saw critical acclaim. Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker stated \"Bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again—to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn\\'t think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston\\'s ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there\\'s a glowing exhilaration about this series: It\\'s a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\" San Francisco Chronicle\\'s Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan\\'s bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\" Horror novelist Stephen King lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.\\nThe third season also saw critical acclaim. Time proclaimed, \"It\\'s a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it\\'s all the hotter for that choice.\" Newsday stated Breaking Bad was still TV\\'s best series and it stayed true to itself. Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the \"visual adventurousness\" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show\\'s visuals \"a combination of staggering beauty – the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits – and transfixing weirdness.\" After the finale aired, The A.V. Club said that season three was \"one of television\\'s finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting – what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing – is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, \\'television good.\\' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers\\' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed.\"Season four won near-universal critical acclaim. The Boston Globe referred to the show as a \"taut exercise in withheld disaster\" and declared the show \"riveting\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette labeled the series \"smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium\". Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011. Time listed Walter White\\'s \"I am the one who knocks\" line as one of the best television lines of 2011. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that \"Breaking Bad is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep.\" The A.V. Club\\'s review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn\\'t mean anybody is home free. Nothing\\'s ever easy on Breaking Bad.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television – truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\"Both halves of the fifth season received overwhelming critical acclaim. Following the end of the series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: \"Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, Breaking Bad is everything you could want in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented.\" During the final season, the show also received praise from George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, particularly the episode \"Ozymandias\"; Martin commented that \"Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros.\" In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, \"This final batch of Breaking Bad is one of the best run of episodes TV has ever offered,\" and praised \"Ozymandias\" in particular, referring to it as \"maybe the best episode of TV [he\\'s] ever seen\". Jonah Goldberg of National Review called it \"the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever\". The veteran actor Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his \"performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen – ever\". He lauded the rest of the cast and crew as well. The letter first appeared on Steven Michael Quezada\\'s (who portrayed DEA Agent Steven Gomez) Facebook page, and in spite of it being taken down, the letter soon went viral. In 2013, Guinness World Records named Breaking Bad the highest-rated TV series of all time, citing its season 5 Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6611610700694929, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8038d2767039430eaf4e145639647cce'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Devotion to family ===\\nThe show explores most of the main characters\\' connections to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family. In the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man\\'s job to provide for his family, even if he is unloved. In the final episode of the series, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the $9.72 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children. Jesse\\'s loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents\\' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane\\'s father, Walt refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he cannot get through to him. Jane\\'s father responds by telling him to keep trying, saying, \"Family. You can\\'t give up on them, ever. What else is there?\" Jane\\'s subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airliner crash at the end of the second season.\\nEven the show\\'s more hardened characters maintain ties to family. In the second season, Tuco Salamanca spends time caring for his physically disabled uncle, Hector. When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge. Their actions are further explained in a flashback, where Hector explains to the brothers that \"La familia es todo\" (\"Family is everything\"). Gustavo Fring\\'s franchise Los Pollos Hermanos translates to \"The Chicken Brothers\". This refers to the fact that the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a romantic relationship. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family and in particular to humiliate Hector and prolong and draw out his suffering. In the first part of the fifth season, it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut\\'s intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter\\'s future, and by his final episode he is conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he has been warned that the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says \"don\\'t skimp on family\", and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think Lydia abandoned her. Much like Walt and Mike, Lydia seems to engage in the meth business in order to provide for her daughter, with actress Laura Fraser stating in an interview that Lydia\\'s daughter is important to how \"Lydia justified what she did to herself\".', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6460439596864461, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'b20e12742c67333c26492632ec1ddc53'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Moral consequences ===\\nIn an interview with The New York Times, creator Vince Gilligan said the larger lesson of the series is that \"actions have consequences\". He elaborated on the show\\'s philosophy:\\nIf religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of Idi Amin living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for Biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that karma kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing that\\'s become my philosophy as well. \\'I want to believe there\\'s a heaven. But I can\\'t not believe there\\'s a hell.\\'\\nIn a piece comparing the show to The Sopranos, Mad Men and The Wire, Chuck Klosterman said that Breaking Bad is \"built on the uncomfortable premise that there\\'s an irrefutable difference between what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong, and it\\'s the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live\". Klosterman added that the central question of Breaking Bad is: \"What makes a man \\'bad\\' – his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?\" Klosterman concluded that in the world of Breaking Bad, \"goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else\".Ross Douthat of The New York Times, in a response to Klosterman\\'s piece, compared Breaking Bad and The Sopranos, stating that both series are \"morality plays\" that are \"both interested in moral agency\". Douthat went on to say that Walter White and Tony Soprano \"represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation, and free will\". Walter is a man who \"deliberately abandons the light for the darkness\" while Tony is \"someone born and raised in darkness\" who turns down \"opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light\".', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6305853117702155, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7feb0c500cfe56ff8a19017a3e43f8f9'}>,\n",

During the series, Gale Boetticher gives Walt a copy of Whitman\\'s Leaves of Grass. Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher recites \"When I Heard the Learn\\'d Astronomer\". In the episode \"Bullet Points\", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher\\'s notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt indicates that they must refer to Whitman.\\nIn the episode \"Hazard Pay\", Walt finds the copy of Leaves of Grass as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles, and leaves it out to read. This occurs at an especially high point in his life, when he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all his ventures. A poem in the book, \"Song of Myself\", is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt\\'s life and Whitman\\'s poetry. The mid-season finale of season five, \"Gliding Over All\", is titled after poem 271 of Leaves of Grass. In the episode, Hank finds Leaves of Grass in Walt\\'s bathroom and opens it to the cover page, where he reads the hand-written inscription: \"To my other favorite W.W.

Coupled with the ongoing writers strike, the first season did not draw as large of a viewership as they expected. However, with subsequent seasons, viewership increased, avoiding the usual trend of downward viewership that most serialized shows had. Ratings further increased by the fourth season as, prior to airing, the previous seasons had been added to Netflix, boosting interest in the show.

Critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the TV series. Although series creator Vince Gilligan and Slovis wanted to shoot Breaking Bad in CinemaScope, Sony and AMC did not grant them permission. Gilligan cited Sergio Leone\\'s Westerns as a reference for how he wanted the series to look. Slovis received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series and Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series.Breaking Bad was shot on 35 mm movie film because of the robustness of the equipment and to keep a focus on shooting scenes economically. It also allowed for a later digital transfer to 4K Ultra HD resolution. By the end of the fifth season, episodes had cost upwards of US$6 million to produce.Kelley Dixon was one of the few editors of Breaking Bad and edited many of the series\\' \"meth montages\".

            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Development history ===\\nThe network ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven episodes, as well as delaying the start of production for the second season. Within the original nine-episode arc, Gilligan had planned to kill off Jesse or Hank, as a \"ballsy\" moment to end the season on. This death was eliminated with the limited episode count, which Gilligan found to be a net positive given the strength of acting that both Paul and Norris brought to these roles through the seasons. The strike also helped to slow down production long enough for Gilligan and his writing team to readjust the pacing of the show, which in the original arc had been moving too quickly. Gould stated that the writer\\'s strike \"saved the show\", as if they had produced the two additional episodes in the first season, they would have gone down a different creative path that he believes would have led to the show\\'s cancellation by its third season.The initial versions of the script were set in Riverside, California, but at the suggestion of Sony, Albuquerque was chosen for the production\\'s location due to the favorable financial conditions offered by the state of New Mexico. Once Gilligan recognized that this would mean \"we\\'d always have to be avoiding the Sandia Mountains\" in shots directed toward the east, the story setting was changed to the actual production location. It was shot primarily on 35 mm film, with digital cameras employed as needed for additional angles, point of view shots and time-lapse photography. Breaking Bad cost $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.Around 2010, AMC had expressed to Sony Pictures Television and Gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for Breaking Bad. Sony started to shop the show around, having gained quick interest from the FX network for two more seasons, upon which AMC changed its mind and allowed the show to continue. At the same time, Netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service and arranged a deal with Sony for Breaking Bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season. Knowing that AMC had placed Breaking Bad on a potential cancellation route, Sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season. Breaking Bad\\'s viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on Netflix, helping to assure that a fifth season could be made. The fifth-season premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere, attributed to the Netflix availability. Gilligan thanked Netflix at the Emmy Awards in September 2013 after the series\\' conclusion for the popularity of the series, saying that Netflix \"kept us on the air\".As the series progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad made Walter increasingly unsympathetic. Gilligan said during the run of the series, \"He\\'s going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they\\'re pulling for, and why.\" Cranston said by the fourth season, \"I think Walt\\'s figured out it\\'s better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He\\'s well on his way to badass.\"In July 2011, Vince Gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude Breaking Bad at the end of its fifth season. In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network AMC and Sony Pictures Television, the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made. On August 14, 2011, AMC renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes. In April 2012, Bryan Cranston revealed that the fifth season would be split into two halves, with the first eight episodes airing in 2012, and the final eight in 2013.Before the series finale, Gilligan said that it was difficult to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: \"I\\'m going to miss the show when it\\'s over, but on some level, it\\'ll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore.\" Gilligan later said the idea for Walter\\'s character intrigued him so much that he \"didn\\'t really give much thought on how well it would sell\", stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was \"such an odd, dark story\" that could have difficulties being pitched to studios. Ultimately, Gilligan chose to end Breaking Bad with Walter\\'s death, occurring in-story two years after he had first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live. Gilligan said by the end of the series, \"it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience\" from the first episode.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6209389984828227, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '8969da9437048e89d2616856d551278'}>,\n",
            "               <Document: {'content': '\\n=== Main characters ===\\nBryan Cranston as Walter White – a high-school chemistry teacher who, shortly after his 50th birthday, is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer and turns to making meth to secure his family\\'s finances. As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation under the alias of \"Heisenberg\". Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it\\'s necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he\\'s occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.\\nAnna Gunn as Skyler White – Walter\\'s wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways. Gunn sees Skyler as \"grounded, tough, smart and driven\". Gunn sees Skyler\\'s stalled writing career as her biggest dream, saying, \"I think she really deep down yearns to be an artist and to be creative and productive.\"\\nAaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman – Walter\\'s cooking partner and former student. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. \"He\\'s just this lost soul – I don\\'t think he\\'s a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd.\" Paul elaborated on the character\\'s background, saying, \"He doesn\\'t come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn\\'t relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse.\" Paul compared the character\\'s relationship with Walt to The Odd Couple.\\nDean Norris as Hank Schrader – Marie\\'s husband, Walter and Skyler\\'s brother-in-law and a DEA agent. At the beginning of the series, Hank was intended to be the \"comic relief\". Norris, who has played several policemen before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I\\'ve talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I\\'ve been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, one of my best friends growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture.\\nBetsy Brandt as Marie Schrader – Skyler\\'s sister and Hank\\'s kleptomaniac wife. Brandt described Marie as \"an unpleasant bitch\", but also stated there was more to her than that. \"I think we\\'re seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family. But it\\'s all about her.\"\\nRJ Mitte as Walter White, Jr. – Walter and Skyler\\'s son, who has cerebral palsy. He begins lashing out after Walter\\'s cancer announcement. Like Walter Jr., Mitte has cerebral palsy, although his is a milder form. Mitte stated he had to regress from his therapy to portray the character, staying up late into the night to slur his speech and learning to walk on crutches so his walking would not look fake.\\nGiancarlo Esposito as Gustavo \"Gus\" Fring (guest season 2, main cast season 3–4) – a Chilean high-level drug distributor who has a cover as an owner of the fast-food chain Los Pollos Hermanos. Esposito stated that for the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his performance. Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about Eddie Olmos way back in Miami Vice. He was like dead – he was hardly breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation – not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone\\'s life. He\\'s just confident.\\nBob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 3–5) – a crooked strip mall lawyer who represents Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk drew inspiration for Goodman from film producer Robert Evans. I thought about Robert Evans because I\\'ve listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He\\'s constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul.\\nJonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut (guest star season 2, main cast season 3–5A) – works for Gus as an all-purpose cleaner and hitman, and also works for Saul as a private investigator. The character of Mike has been compared to Harvey Keitel\\'s Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction, which Banks says he is not trying to emulate: \"I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain\\'t my cleaner. But throughout this world, you would suspect there had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors.\"\\nLaura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (recurring season 5A, main cast season 5B) – a high-ranking employee of Madrigal Electromotive and a former associate of Gus Fring. She reluctantly begins supplying Walt and Jesse with methylamine and helps Walt expand his operation overseas.\\nJesse Plemons as Todd Alquist (recurring season 5A, main cast season 5B) – an employee of Vamonos Pest Control who becomes an associate of Walt and Jesse.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6094299384676392, 'meta': {'name': 'wiki_data.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '3126d28ca3848c775dccd013e1ff82c0'}>],\n",
